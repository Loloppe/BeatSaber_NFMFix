# BeatSaber_NoteMovementFix  

Features (All those features modify gameplay Ã¬n a way or another. Using this plugin is at your own risk if you decide to upload scores with it):  
- Disable NJS Cheesing (Remove the fixed spawn position and make it playable no matter the player Z position).  
- Disable Look Ahead (Remove the very fast section before the notes slow down. Very good for muscle memory training or as a challenge).  
- Disable Note Shuffle (Double notes swap become instant. Can be done in completely legit way, I merely took a shortcut here).  
- Disable Note Rotation (Initial rotation become instant and remove the note visual sway. Pretty cool for video).  

Features that disable score submission:  
- Disable Note Rotation Towards Player (Won't look toward the player while near the player).
