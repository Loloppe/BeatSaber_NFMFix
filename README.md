# BeatSaber_NoteMovementFix  

Warning: This plugin isn't purely visual. For example, rotation affect hitbox, althought the difference is completely indistinguishable score-wise.
All of this could of been done visually. I just took a shortcut out of laziness: rewrote the whole note movement code.

- Disable Note Rotation Towards Player 

Settings?
